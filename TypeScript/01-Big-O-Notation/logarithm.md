# Logarithm

Logarithms are crucial in computer science, particularly in algorithm analysis, because they often describe <ins>how certain algorithms reduce their problem space.</ins>

For instance, binary search operates in logarithmic time, `O(log n)`, because it divides the data set in half with each step, significantly shrinking the size of the problem.

Logarithmic time complexity is great. Take a look at [Big O Notation Visualized](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*KfZYFUT2OKfjekJlCeYvuQ.jpeg).
