## Overview

**Searching algorithms** are methods used to find specific elements within a data structure (such as an array, list, or tree). They help locate data efficiently based on a given key or condition.

- **Linear Search** – Checks each element one by one until it finds the target. (O(n) time complexity)
- **Binary Search** – Divides a sorted array in half repeatedly until the target is found. (O(log n) time complexity)
- **KMP String Search** - Searches for a pattern in a text by using a precomputed LPS array to avoid redundant comparisons after mismatches. (O(n) time complexity)

## Linear Search

**Linear search** or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

This is the most straightforward one, and many JavaScript methods use this algorithm such as `indexOf`, `includes`, `find`, and `findIndex`.
